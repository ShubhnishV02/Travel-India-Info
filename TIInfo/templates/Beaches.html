                        Replete with turquoise blue water beaches and a bit of history, Andaman & Nicobar Islands is a little slice of paradise tucked around 1,400 km away from the east coast of mainland India. Port Blair, the capital of this union territory, has a major airport and seaport connected with the rest of the country and with various tourist islands via multiple daily ferries. Havelock and Neil Islands are popular among tourists for their white sandy beaches and excellent diving options. <br>

                        Andaman & Nicobar Islands comprises 572 islands, only 37 of which are inhabited, and a few are open to tourists. Havelock Island is one of the largest and the most popular islands of all Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Travellers typically enter from Port Blair via flight or ship and spend multiple nights in Havelock and Neil Islands that offer some great resorts.<br>

                        The southern coast of the Havelock island has the charming Radhanagar Beach, while the azure beauty of Vijayanagar Beach is situated towards the east of the island.  Perhaps the most endearing feature of Neil island is its three sandy beaches, namely Bharatpur Beach, Sitapur Beach and Lakshmanpur Beaches.<br>

                        Port Blair is generally used as a base city to catch ferries to nearby islands. However, tourists also spend a day or two here to explore the town and nearby beaches. People also take day trips to Ross Island and North Bay Island or Baratang and Jolly Buoy island from Port Blair. <br>

                        Andamans have the most exotic beach and some of them also give the opportunity of trying out a number of Water sports such as Scuba Diving, Snorkeling, Sea Walk etc. North Bay Island near Port Blair, Elephant Beach in Havelock Island and Bharatpur Beach in Neil Island are three popular beaches to try out watersports. Elephant beach and Kalapather beach are two other beaches where the sunrise and sunsets are absolutely divine.

                        Formerly known as Laccadive Islands, Lakshadweep translates to 'one hundred thousand islands' in Malayalam. Home to a few of the most beautiful and exotic islands and beaches of India, Lakshadweep lies 400km off the southwest coast of the Arabian Sea. The smallest union territory of India has only 36 islands having a total area of 32 sq. kilometres. It's made up of 12 atolls, 3 reefs and 5 submerged banks out of which ten Islands are inhabited.<br>

                        Lakshadweep is typically accessed from Kochi (Kerala) and a permit is required to visit Lakshadweep for all tourists (including Indians). After permit, Indians are permitted to visit all islands, however, even after permit, foreigners are permitted to just visit Agatti, Bangaram and Kadmat Islands. Permits can be obtained from Kochi itself.<br>

                        Perhaps the charm of Lakshadweep islands lies in their remoteness. Far off the beaten track, they attract no hordes of merrymakers to their shores. The islands, though all equally mystical and beautiful, each offers a unique blend of tourist spots. Some islands have been promoted for diving and water sports, still, others have been developed so that people enjoy the charm of relaxation.

                        With its pristine beaches and breathtaking landscapes, Gokarna is a Hindu pilgrimage town in Karnataka and a newly found hub for beach lovers and hippies. Situated on the coast of Karwar, every year Gokarna welcomes hordes of tourists from around the world in search of sanctity and relaxation. The out-of-town beaches like Kudle beach and Om Beach are a different contrast to life inside the town. <br>

                        Palm clad beaches are dotted with foreign tourists in a majority and very few Indians are seen across. Gokarna is not very conventionally touristy. The beaches are meant for a slow, relaxed holiday and everything on the beach goes at the same relaxed pace. Full of coconut and palm trees, the ocean and clean sands, Gokarna is a 'one of a kind' place in the country.

                        Famous for its resorts and ayurvedic massage centres, Kovalam is a coastal town located around 13 km from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. The largest beach in Kovalam is the lighthouse beach that features a 30-metre tall lighthouse. The other two adjacent beaches are Samudra beach and Hawa beach. All these three beaches are crescent-shaped shallow water and low tidal beaches.<br>

                        Earlier a fishing village, Kovalam started attracting tourists in the 1930s and shot to fame in the hippie era of 1970s. It still sees the influx of tourists from Israel and Europe. <br>
                        Ayurvedic treatments and massages are one of its most popular indulgences along with yoga, meditation as well as other cultural activities. Kovalam perhaps comes full circle as it is also a shopping destination given the rich spices, wooden statues and handicrafts that can make popular takeaways.

                    <p class="card-text" style="font-size:13px;">
                        Puri in Odisha is one of the four must-visit pilgrimage sites for Hindus because of Jagannath Temple that forms the part of Char Dham in India. Puri is a beach city located on the coast of Bay of Bengal which is one of the favourites among people of West Bengal for a short trip.<br>

                        Having gained popularity among hippies back in the 1970s due to the legalisation of Bhang, Puri is still a popular destination among backpackers, however, the availability of bhang is now limited. With a plethora of hotels and homestays, the local tourist like to stay near the New Marine Drive and the backpackers prefer to stay near Chakra Tirtha. The Rath Yatra (chariot festival) which takes place during the month of June-July should not be missed if you are planning to visit during this time.<br>

                        Known as the resting place of Lord Shiva, the majestic history and heritage of Puri date back to the 3rd century B. C. Puri, Konark and Bhubaneshwar complete the Golden Triangle of Orissa, with their religious significance and cultural heritage being the centres of tourism in this state. There are a lot of places near Puri that one must visit, like the Chilika lake, Puri beach, Gundicha Ghar and the very famous Sun temple of Konark. Puri is soon turning into an industrial hub with major manufacturing companies coming here.

                        Bordered by the three seas - Arabian, Indian and the Bay of Bengal, Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula. A small coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kanyakumari was earlier known as Cape Comorin. <br>

                        Kanyakumari offers the marvellous confluence of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian ocean meeting together at a point. But, this is not a miracle, the miracle lies in the beauty that the water of three seas does not mix, you can clearly distinguish between the turquoise blue, deep blue and sea green waters of the three seas. To enjoy the best view of sunset and sunrise, you can visit the Triveni Sangam point and the famous View tower. <br>

                        The town has a mountainous terrain with elevated patches of hills, coconut trees and lined with paddy fields. Kanyakumari is also the only place in India where you can observe the sunrise and sunset at the same beach. <br>

                        The town is not only popular for its unique phenomenon but also its temples and the Vivekananda Rock Memorial among other iconic monuments.<br>

                        Waterfalls in Kanyakumari that you should not miss out on include the Thirparappu falls, the Courtallam Falls, and the Olakaruvi falls. Kanyakumari has authentic South Indian cuisine, with seafood and coconuts being an integral part of almost all dishes.

Being a fisherman's paradise, Talasari doesn't experience much tourist rush. There is a concrete structure where fishermen trap their fishes and sell them in a fish market near the beach where you can also find cooked chicken, crabs and fish.

                    <p class="card-text" style="font-size:13px;">
                        Paradise Beach, also known as Plage Paradiso, is situated in Chunnambar, close to Pondicherry town. Adorned with the golden sand, this is a little-isolated beach. To reach here, you have to take a ferry across the backwaters, which takes around 20-30 minutes. There are a few shacks along the main entrance to the beach, and you can get fresh coconut water and some simple snacks - don't expect any fancy street food though. <br>

                        Part of the fun in reaching the beach is the beautiful ferry from the boathouse - the backwaters on the way to the beach are green and have thick mangrove forests. Especially after the monsoons, the backwaters are fresh and green. You can spot a lot of birds while on the ride - and photography enthusiasts would relish the opportunity to get some great photos here. <br>
                        The currents in the water are high, so it is advisable to not go deep in the water. Paradise beach is a great spot to reach early morning and get a view of the sunrise on the eastern coast. A variety of water sports facilities are available here as well. The travellers can try fishing as well: fishing rods and nets are easily available for rent.

                                        green blanket of leaves.
