                    <p class="card-text" style="font-size:13px;">
                        One of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal is located on the banks of River Yamuna in
                        Agra.
                        It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It
                        also houses
                        the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century,
                        Taj Mahal is one
                        of the most beautiful monuments in the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire
                        population of
                        Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument! <br>

                        A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of Palaces in the Persian
                        language. The tomb
                        is laid out in a rectangular shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which has an
                        arch and
                        alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and fountains in the entrance which makes
                        the monument
                        even more spectacular. The reflection of this majestic spectacle in the Yamuna is almost poetic
                        in its
                        perfection! <br>

                        Covering an area of approximately 42 Acres, the construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and
                        it took 17 years before it was completed in 1648! It was constructed using white marble obtained
                        from Makrana in Rajasthan.

                        An incredibly breathtaking example of Indo - Saracenic style of architecture, the Mysore Palace
                        is a magnificent edifice located in Mysore in the state of Karnataka. Also known as the Amba
                        Vilas Palace, it is the former palace of the royal family of Mysore and is still their official
                        residence. Mysore Palace was built in the year 1912 for the 24th Ruler of the Wodeyar Dynasty
                        and is counted amongst one of the biggest palaces in the country.<br>

                        The construction of the Mysore Palace was orchestrated by the Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV
                        referred as "Rajarishi" (saintly king) by Mahatma Gandhi. It was then further expanded by his
                        son and the last Maharaja of Mysore, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. The facade of the palace is
                        a harmonious blend of Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and Gothic styles which imparts it a regal quality.
                        With the Chamundi Hills towards its eastern side, the spectacle of the Mysore Palace is an
                        enchanting sight to behold. Needless to say, it is the second most visited historical monument
                        visited by both local and foreign tourists after the Taj Mahal. Presently located inside the Old
                        Fort, Mysore Palace is renowned for its light & sound show and vibrant Dussehra celebrations.

                    <p class="card-text" style="font-size:13px;">
                        One of the most spiritual places in India, the Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib,
                        is the holiest shrine in all of Sikhism. Located right in the heart of Amritsar, the stunning
                        golden architecture of the temple and the daily Langar (community kitchen) attract a large
                        number of visitors and devotees each day. The temple is open to devotees of all faiths and
                        serves over 100,000 people free food from all walks of life.<br>

                        The main Temple housing the shrine is a small part of the vast complex known as Harmandir Sahib
                        or Darbar Sahib to the Sikhs. The spiritual focus is the tank, the Amrit Sarovar, which
                        surrounds the glistening central shrine. Around the edges of the compound, there are more
                        shrines and monuments. The Sikh Museum is located inside the main entrance clock tower which
                        shows the oppression endured by the Sikhs at the hands of the Mughals, the British and the
                        Indian Government of 1984. The Ramgarhia Bunga is a protective fortress located at the southeast
                        end of the tank and is surrounded by two Islamic-style minarets. Golden Temple is indisputably
                        one of the most exquisite attractions in the world.

                                    1. Remove your shoes and socks before entering the temple compound (there is sandal
                                    stand at the entrance). Wash your feet in the shallow foot baths located nearby.
                                    <br>

                                    2. Dress appropriately. The body must be fully covered, and you need to cover your
                                    head which is a sign of respect in the gurudwara. Scarves can be borrowed free of
                                    charge or bought from the hawkers who sell souvenir scarves for INR 10. However, it
                                    is prudent to carry a scarf with you.<br>

                                    3. Tobacco and alcohol are strictly prohibited.<br>

                                    4. If you wish to sit beside the tank, sit cross-legged and do not dip your feet in
                                    the water.<br>

                                    5. Photography is permitted near the walkway surrounding the tank but not inside the
                                    Golden Temple itself.

                        Ajanta and Ellora caves, considered to be one of the finest examples of ancient rock-cut caves, are located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, India. Ajanta and Ellora caves complex is adorned with beautiful sculptures, paintings, and frescoes and include Buddhist monasteries, Hindu and Jain temples. The Ajanta caves are 29 in number and were built between the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD, whereas the Ellora Caves are more spread out and 34 in number and dates to the period between 6th and 11th Century AD. <br>

                        Ajanta and Ellora caves are designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are quite popular among travelers worldwide. Ajanta Caves, 
                        located around 99km north of Aurangabad, are mostly Buddhist sites and were used as a retreat by Buddhist Monks. Ellora is just 15 km west of Aurangabad and has a better mix of Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist sites. These hand-carved caves were built and sponsored by the Indian rulers of those periods and almost buried by thick forests. One of the most famous places in the entire Ajanta and Ellora Caves is the Kailash Temple, which is also the single most massive monolithic structure globally. These rock-cut caves containing carvings are some of the best examples of ancient Indian architecture and sculpture.

                        Located in the national capital of New Delhi, the Lotus Temple is an edifice dedicated to the Baha'i faith. The magnificent structure of this building unfolds in the form of a stupendous white petal lotus and is one of the most visited establishments in the world. The design of this shrine was conceptualized by Canadian architect Fariborz Sahba and was completed in the year 1986. This temple seeks to propagate the oneness of the Almighty and is open to all regardless of their nationality, religion, race or gender. The Lotus temple is one of the seven Baha'i House of Worship present around the world. <br>

                        As you enter the complex of the temple, you encounter an enchanting entrance gate, beautiful floral gardens and scintillating pools. The pathway leading up to the temple doors is lined with lush green shrubs and a feeling of tranquillity adorns the atmosphere despite the bubbling crowd. Once inside, the mesmerising architecture will lull you into an introspective silence. You can read and chant religious texts of any faith, and musical renditions of religious texts can be sung without any inhibitions in the temple complex. The Bahai Lotus Temple is without a doubt one of the must-visit places in the capital. Not just for its marvellous architecture but also to experience a new way of meditation in a completely different, blissful ambience.

                                    1. Lotus Temple is a place for silent prayer and meditation for people of all religious backgrounds. So one should not make noise.
                                    2. Prayers timings are 10:AM, 12:00PM, 3:00PM and 5:00PM for five minutes and a few prayers from different religions are chanted or read out loud. People are requested to not leave the Prayer Hall during this time, but wait until the prayers are over.
                                    3. Reading non- scriptural texts, delivering sermons, playing instruments and fundraising are forbidden here.

                        The massive edifice of Hawa Mahal stands at the intersection of the main road in Jaipur, Badi Chaupad and was built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in the year 1799. Hawa Mahal derives its name from its unique structure, which is a mesh of small windows that allowed cool wind to enter the palace and hence kept the palace comfortable during the hot summer months. The main reason behind the palace's construction was to allow the women of the royal house to observe the festivities on the streets whilst being unseen from the outside as was the custom of the land. It is located right on the edge of the City Palace Jaipur and extends right to the 'zenana'. <br>

                        Hawa Mahal is a structure made of red and pink sandstone and has a pyramidal structure which almost resembles a crown. It has been embellished with 953 tiny windows, also known as 'Jharokhas' and embellished with gorgeous latticework. From within, the Hawa Mahal palace is based on five floors each of which has a uniquely decorated chamber. A charming fountain welcomes you inside the main palace, from whereon you can make your way up to the different floors. The top of the palace offers a brilliant view of the City Palace, Jantar Mantar and the ever-busy Siredeori Bazar. There is a small museum as well which holds some rich relics and miniature paintings.

                        Another relic of the British Raj in India, the Victoria Memorial is located in the heart of Kolkata, in West Bengal. This white marbled opulent structure was built in memory of Queen Victoria to celebrate her 25 years of rule over India and is almost a replica of the Victoria Memorial in London. Victoria Memorial is an iconic structure that is synonymous with the city of joy! <br>

                        The memorial is surrounded by a lush green and well-maintained garden, which spreads over 64 acres and has numerous statues and sculptures in it. A sixteen-foot tall bronze statue of victory, mounted on ball bearings at the top of the memorial, serves to heighten the overall appeal and grandeur of the entire complex. Victoria Memorial is breathtaking and marvellous, especially at night, when it is illuminated. The Sound and Light shows that take place in the evening are an added delight, and a must watch. All in all, the place is a must visit for people to wish to relive the essence of the Victorian era in the modern day world.

                        Qutub Minar is a minaret or a victory tower located in Qutub complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi's Mehrauli area. With the height of 72.5 metres (238 ft), Qutub Minar is the second tallest monument of Delhi. Its construction was started in 1192 by Qutb Ud-Din-Aibak, founder of Delhi Sultanate after he defeated the last Hindu Ruler of Delhi. He constructed the basement, after which the construction was taken over by his son-in-law and successor Iltutmish who constructed three additional stories. The fourth and fifth storeys were built by Firoz Shah Tuglak.

                        The Gateway of India is, without doubt, one of the most popular tourist hotspots of Mumbai. Sitting proudly on the Apollo Bunder, it overlooks the Arabian Sea. It is one of the defining monuments of the city of Mumbai and was built in the year 1924. The construction was undertaken by the famous architect George Wittet, to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai. The imposing structure of the monument is a beautiful confluence of Indian, Arabic and Western architecture and has become a popular tourist hub in the city. It is also the starting point of a number of ferry services that ply to the historic Elephanta Caves.<br>

                        Nicknamed 'Mumbai's Taj Mahal', the foundation of this landmark was laid in 1911 and it was inaugurated 13 years later in 1924. The structure in itself is a made of yellow basalt and solid concrete and is embellished with numerous Muslim and Hindu motifs as well. The basalt arch of the Gateway served as the entry and exit access to India through waterways before independence and was the exit point from where the last British ship left India for England. There are statues of Swami Vivekananda and Chhatrapati Shivaji that have been installed near the Gateway as well. The view from the sea of the Gateway complex, especially at night is quite ethereal and beautiful. The Gateway of India is thus, not only a historic artefact but an example of marvellous architecture in itself!

This 42-meter tall historical structure was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of the largest war memorials in the country. India Gate is also famous for hosting the Republic Day Parade every year.  <br>

                        Dedicated to 82,000 Indian and British soldiers who died during the First World War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, this monument has the names of 13,300 servicemen inscribed on its surface. The premises of India Gate also houses the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which is a kindled structure right underneath the archway. Owing to its rich historical background and astonishing architecture, India Gate has become one of the most popular picnic spots in the city.

                        An architectural masterpiece, The Red Fort of Agra or Agra Fort was built by Emperor Akbar in 1573.

One of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, it lies 2.5 kilometres from Taj Mahal. <br>

                        Also known as Lal – Qila, Fort Rouge or Qila-i-Akbari, Agra Fort is a symbol of Agra and is so massive that it is often referred to as a walled city. It is the perfect example of Mughal art and architecture, built purely out of red sandstone. Within the premises of Agra Fort lie the most exquisite structures like the Pearl Mosque, Diwan-i I Khas, Diwan-i I Aam, Moti Masjid and Jahangiri Mahal. Some part of the Agra Fort is used by the Indian Army is off-limit to public access. View of Yamuna River and Taj Mahal from the fort's pavilions is mind-stirring.

                        An identifying feature of the city, Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar. <br>

                        Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four 'khalifas' (Prophets) of Islam. Towards the north of the monument, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which have been constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. In its present form, Charminar, along with Qutub Shahi Tombs and the Golconda Fort, has been added to the 'tentative list' of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

                        The Red Fort is a historical fortification in the old Delhi area. Shah Jahan constructed it in the year 1639 as a result of a capital shift from Agra to Delhi. Used as the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal dynasty, this imposing piece of architecture derives its name from its impregnable red sandstone walls. In addition to accommodating the emperors and their households, it was the ceremonial and political centre of the Mughal state and the setting for events critically impacting the region. Today, this monument is home to several museums that have an assortment of precious artefacts on display. Every year, the Indian Prime Minister unfurls the national flag here on the Independence Day. <br>

                        Formerly known as Quila-e-Mubarak or the Blessed Fort, the Red Fort lies along the banks of the river Yamuna, whose waters fed the moats surrounding the fort. It was a part of the medieval city of Shahjahanabad, popularly known today as 'Old Delhi'. The entire fort complex is said to represent the architectural creativity and brilliance of Mughal architecture. With so much history and heritage associated with it, the Red Fort is one of the most popular monuments in India and a major tourist attraction in Delhi. It became a UNESCO world heritage site in 2007. The Archaeological Survey of India is at present responsible for the security and preservation of this magnificent monument.

                        Located at a distance of 40km from Agra, Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra district and a famous tourist attraction. A city predominantly made of red sandstone, Fatehpur Sikri was founded in 1571 century by Mughal Emperor Akbar. It is essentially a fortified city built by the king and had been the capital of his Empire for fifteen years. Now a UNESCO world heritage site, it is home to Jodha Bai's Palace, Jama Mosque, Buland Darwaza, and Tomb of Salim Chisti among many other famous monuments. Derived from Arab and central Asian tent encampments, the Imperial Complex is a work of pavilions arranged in formal geometry on a piece of land. <br>

                        A unique blend of architectural excellence, as well as religious beliefs - sums up Fatehpur Sikri. It was built by Akbar to honour Sheikh Salim Chisti, whose prediction of the birth of a Mughal heir came true while Akbar was visiting the then city of Sikri. In honour of the prophecy, Akbar built this city and Jama Masjid, a stunning mosque which is still in use today. He also undertook the construction of three palaces for each of his favourite wives, one a Hindu, one a Muslim and one a Christian. An Indo-Islamic Masterpiece, Fatehpur Sikri look its resplendent best during sunset.
